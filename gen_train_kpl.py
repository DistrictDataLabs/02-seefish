gen_train.py

I use PILLOW; original seems to be using ImageMagick.
TODO: Figure out which, and then whether Iâ€™m doing the same.

This train version is very similar to the image resizing done in get_train.py, 
except that it has all the identifying subfolders. In the test case, the images
are kept in one folder, as we don't know their identities.

If we don't need the 8-bit 48x48 images, it would make sense to do the resizing
and converting to binary in one sweep.
TODO: Check whether the 8-bit versions of the resized images are ever used. If
the resizing needs to be redone because of aspect ratio, and the 8-bit imgs are
never used, combine the operations in one routine.

TODO: Rework this as it was originally, a program to be called with input args.
