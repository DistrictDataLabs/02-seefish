gen_test.py

I use PILLOW; original uses ImageMagick, "convert -resize 48x48\!"  The "!"
has to do with aspect ratio, preserving it or not. 
TODO: Figure out which, and then whether Iâ€™m doing the same.

This test version is very similar to the image resizing done in get_train.py, 
except that there are no subfolders.  In the training case, the images were 
kept in an identifying folder, here we don't know the identity of the images.

If we don't need the 8-bit 48x48 images, it would make sense to do the resizing
and converting to binary in one sweep.
TODO: Check whether the 8-bit versions of the resized images are ever used. If
the resizing needs to be redone because of aspect ratio, and the 8-bit imgs are
never used, combine the operations in one routine.

TODO: Rework this as it was originally, a program to be called with input args.
